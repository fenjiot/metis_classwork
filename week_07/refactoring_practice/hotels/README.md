# Hotel Database

A hotel database and searching app.

The hotel database reads in a file (in this case hotels.csv).

It then prompts the user which property (hotel) they want to view.

After getting the input, it will fetch the appropriate hotel's data.

There is also a parser, that parses that data to keep everything neatly stored.
